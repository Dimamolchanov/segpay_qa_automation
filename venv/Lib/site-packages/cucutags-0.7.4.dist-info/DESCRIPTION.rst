cucutags provides a simple generator of ctags-like tags file for
the combination of `Gherkin language features`_ and Python
steps_ .

.. _`Gherkin language features`:
    https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin
.. _steps:
    https://github.com/behave/behave

Unfortunately, no text editor known to me is able to use so generated
tags file. However, this script can be also used by any other Python
script as a library, and thus for example vim_ can use it via
vim-behave_ plugin or gedit_ via the gedit_behave_ one.

.. _vim:
    http://www.vim.org
.. _vim-behave:
    https://gitorious.org/cucutags/vim-behave
.. _gedit:
    https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit
.. _gedit_behave:
    https://gitorious.org/cucutags/gedit_behave

All bug reports and enhancement requests, please, send to the
email listed in the script file.
